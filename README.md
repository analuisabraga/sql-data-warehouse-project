# sql-data-warehouse-project
In this project, I designed and implemented a data warehouse from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as .csv files. The process involved ETL/ELT workflows including data cleasining, standardization, normalization and enrichment. The final data model supports seamless data integration providing a solid foundation for decision-making.
