# sql-data-warehouse-project
In this project, I designed and implemented a data warehouse from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as .csv files. The process involved ETL/ELT workflows including data cleasining, standardization, normalization and enrichment. The final data model supports seamless data integration providing a solid foundation for business analysis and decision-making.

‚õÅ Building a Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Goal:
Design and implement a robust data warehouse using SQL Server to centralize sales data, enhancing analytical capabilities and enabling data-driven decision-making.

Key Specifications:
    - Data Sources: Ingest data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
    - Data Quality: Clean and standardize the data to address quality issues before analysis.
    - Integration: Merge both sources into a unified, query-optimized data model designed for analytical purposes.
    - Scope: Prioritize the most recent dataset without incorporating historical data.
    - Documentation: Deliver detailed documentation to guide business stakeholders and analytics teams in using the data model effectively.

üìä Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Goal:
Develop SQL-based analytical solutions to generate actionable insights into:
    - Customer Behavior
    - Product Performance
    - Sales Trends

These insights will equip stakeholders with essential business metrics, facilitating informed strategic decisions.
